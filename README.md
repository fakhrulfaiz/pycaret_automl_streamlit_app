# AutoStreamML: Pycaret AutoML Streamlit App

## Overview

AutoStreamML is a user-friendly Streamlit application designed to streamline the process of building automated Machine Learning pipelines using PyCaret. This app allows users to upload datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), train machine learning models, and download the trained modelâ€”all through a simple web interface.

## Features

- **Upload Data**: Easily upload your dataset in CSV format.
- **Profiling**: Perform automated exploratory data analysis using ydata-profiling.
- **Machine Learning**: Train machine learning models with PyCaret's regression module.
- **Download Model**: Download the trained model for future use.
